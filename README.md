Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a telecommunications dataset to inform strategic business decisions. The analysis focuses on user overview, engagement, experience, and satisfaction.

Objectives

1. Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the telecommunications dataset.
2. Identify key features that drive user engagement, experience, and satisfaction.
3. Provide actionable insights for business stakeholders to refine their strategies.

Key Findings

1. Top 10 handsets used by customers, along with their manufacturers.
2. User engagement metrics, including session frequency, duration, and total traffic.
3. User experience metrics, including network parameters and device characteristics.
4. User satisfaction scores, based on engagement and experience metrics.

Insights

- Engagement and Satisfaction Correlation: There is a positive correlation between engagement and satisfaction scores. As engagement scores increase, satisfaction scores also tend to increase. This suggests that users who are more engaged with the product or service tend to be more satisfied.
- Consistent Experience Scores: Experience scores remain consistent across all data points, with a score of 1.0. This could indicate that the experience of using the product or service is uniform across all users.
- Variance in Satisfaction Scores: Satisfaction scores vary widely, ranging from 126,037,214 to 1,366,386,971. This suggests that there are opportunities for improvement in terms of satisfaction, as some users are much more satisfied than others.

Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights for telecommunications businesses, highlighting the importance of considering user behavior, engagement, experience, and satisfaction when making strategic decisions.
